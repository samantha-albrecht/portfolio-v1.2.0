            Growing up I thought failure was not an option. Success to me was
            straight Aâ€™s and a 4.0 GPA. This quote opened my mind to see that
            failure is an option, it's inevitable as a creative. Design and
            development require the willingness to try something new knowing it
            could fail in order to learn, grow, and eventually
            find&nbsp;success.
